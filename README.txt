This is a simple shooter game. You can control your player by using WASD, TGFH, or Xbox Controls.
You can swap controls by using the buttons available on the HUD.
To shoot a bullet, use either right mouse or right trigger.
In front of you is a scary cube, he is your enemy.
If you touch the enemy, your health will deplete as shown in the health bar at the top of the screen.
However, every 10 seconds you will heal up.
To kill the enemy, simply keep shooting it. You will randomly cycle between small and large bullets.
The large bullets do more damage than the small bullets.
The only requirement I was unable to finish was the custom keybinds.
